        <h5>General</h5>
        <p>This small project is made by Richard Lindholm in .NET core with a Angular frontend. It's made as a learning project to get experience in Angular.</p>
        <h5>Sidebar Menu</h5>
        <p>A sidebar based on, more or less, every video tutorial for a sidebar made on YouTube. Nothing fancy really, but it works and looks pretty ok.
        Other than the standard navigation links and the "Site name", the sidebar also has a search and a Dark Mode toggle switch.</p>
        <h5>Tour of Heroes</h5>
        <p>The first module (that's not generated on creation) made in this project.
        It's based on the <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes" target="_blank">tutorial from Angular's site</a> and then modified to fit my "needs".
        The heroes are saved through an API connected to a database hosted by Azure.</p>
        <h5>Credit Card</h5>
        <p>Original idea was to format the input text, as it's written, in credit card format (xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx) by using an Angular Pipe.
        After a few trail and error it was changed to a Directive and now it works more or less as planned from the beginning (with a little comical touch).</p>
        <h5>Tree Grid</h5>
        <p>Based on the assignment I got when being recruited. It's still the same code in the backend, but the visual part (frontend) is upgraded.
        Also added the ability to generate a new "forest" to test the code and the visuals.</p>
        <h5>Stats (Charts)</h5>
        <p>Added some charts powered by Google Charts with some of the data from the Tree Grid mentioned before.</p>
        <h5>Counter (/Messages/Log)</h5>
        <p>Part of the "Tour of Heroes" tutorial. A simple log system that prints all the logged messages.</p>
        <h5>Weather</h5>
        <p>Part of the generated code. Modified to show a more correct Summary based on the temperature.</p>
